ðŸŽ¤: horror
You have chosen the genre: Horror


Black Hollow Academy was built in 1812, a sprawling estate of cold stone and older secrets. The new scholarship students arrived just before winterâ€”seven of them, handpicked. The eighth bed in the dormitory is always made, though no one remembers doing it. At night, they hear it creak as if someone is lying downâ€¦ and each morning, one of them wakes up with someone else's nightmare.
What's your student's name: Kai
Describe your student: Scared of everything
Brace yourself Kai, the nightmare is just beginning!


You hear whispers in the hallways, shadows moving where there should be none. The headmaster is strict, but there's something off about him. The other students are friendly, but their eyes seem to hold secrets.
Do you want to visit the library or talk to the headmaster? Alternatively, you can gather with the other students to share stories of the strange occurrences.
ðŸ‘»: headmaster
You try to meet with the headmaster but he's not there... You feel a sense of unease as you realize that he might be hiding something.
You decide to investigate his office, but it's locked. You hear strange noises coming from behind the door...
Do you want to try to pick the lock or leave it alone? (pick/leave): pick
You manage to pick the lock and enter the office. The walls are lined with portraits of previous headmasters, their eyes seeming to follow you.
You find a hidden drawer in the desk containing a key and a letter revealing the headmaster's dark past.

Oh! Looks like you pressed Ctrl+C. Instead of stop. Rude.
