## How to Play

Currently, the **horror** genre is the most developed storyline.

4. **Exit Anytime**: Type 'stop' to end your adventure

## Current Development Status

- ðŸ”§ **Horror**: Basic developed storyline with multiple choices and outcomes
- ðŸš§ **Mystery**: Basic character creation implemented
- ðŸš§ **Alternative History**: Character creation and basic setup
- ðŸš§ **Fantasy**: Character creation and basic setup  
- ðŸš§ **Science Fiction**: Character creation and basic setup

## Bugs

- Translations are not always right. May need to add spaces to ensure the translation comes out better. Or more words? But then it messes up how I am looking for choices. Might to rethink my keywords to make it work better overall.
- MAN there is no space between my input and the printed text. Looks bad man.
- When the sub choice is made, and it's incorrect, it will bounce you back to the first choice. Need to fix that.
- ~~Exiting now causes issues (ctrl + c). Has to do with async/await~~ Fixed by wrapping my call to main in try catch.
- ~~Refactor the choices to more readable functions. They getting long~~ Using a dataset solved this problem.
