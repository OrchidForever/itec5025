## Thoughts
Not how I imagined writing a bot. Kinda wiplash from my current job of using google ADK to write a bot.

I'm worried that this method won't work for my actually project deisgns I wrote last class. I apparently took AI and was like bet.

My database is most based in vectors and I vectorize the user's search to search my database with a cosine search. Then use a LLM to give an answer. 

That is the type of AI I thought of when I saw AI.

I feel like I missed the point by a mile.
